# Four Color Theorem
The four color theorem states that no more than four colors are needed to color a map so that no two adjacent countries/regions have the same color.

*an example four color map of the USA. For more information click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem).*

I created an algorithm in C++ which finds a four color solution to a given map.

Maps must be given in a format such as:

```
AAAAA
ABBBB
ACBCC
ADDBC
AEEEB
```
